Endless sense of discovery
Always something new around the corner
Roads stretch forever like Chrome dino game
Never know what you'll find next
Feels like a real, living world
```

3. **Scattered Features** - Mountains, forests, cities appear throughout
4. **Always Something Ahead** - Never know what's around next corner
5. **Seamless Exploration** - No loading, no boundaries, pure discovery

   - Always know which direction has a road
   - Never truly lost

2. **Scattered Features**: Mountains, forests, cities spread across
   - Always something interesting
   - Different terrain in each region
   - Never feels empty

3. **Infinite Wrapping**: Drive off edge → reappear on opposite
   - No "death" on boundaries
   - Continuous exploration
   - Feels endless

4. **Variable Terrain**: 
   - North region (mountains)
   - West region (forests)
   - South region (cities)
   - East region (water & bridges)
   - Center region (mixed)
